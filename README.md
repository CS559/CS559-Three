# CS559-Three
Landing page for versions of THREE.JS for CS559

In CS559, we use the [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) library. We make a "special version" for class. 
(it isn't any different, we just pick a specific version to use for the whole semester)

Each year, we start the semester with the current version. 
In 2022 it was r137. 
In 2023 it was r148.

Because we have a different version each year, it is easier to have a separate repo for each year.

For example, you might want: 
- [2023 CS 559 Three Repo](https://github.com/CS559/CS559-Three23) - we are using the standard documentation
- [2022 CS 559 Three Repo](https://github.com/CS559/CS559-Three22) or it's associated [documentation](https://cs559.github.io/ThreeDocs_r137/)
